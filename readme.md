- `unread()`
- `instance()`

```js
function App() {
  const ref = React.createRef<AnnounceKit>();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    ref.current.unread().then(an => console.log("unread", an));
  });

  return (
    <div>
        <button onClick={async() => await ref.current.open()}>
            Click to open widget
        </button>
        <AnnounceKit ref={ref} widget="https://announcekit.co/widgets/v2/3xdhio">
            <span>Whats new</span>
        </AnnounceKit>
    </div>
    )
}
```
